The rapid increase in the number of vehicles over the past few decades has made it challenging to monitor all vehicles effectively for traffic management and law enforcement. To address this, we proposed a computer vision-based solution using deep learning to automatically identify traffic violators. The system focuses on detecting violations such as overspeeding, overloading, not wearing helmets, and driving on the wrong side. It leverages Yolov3 for object detection and DeepSort for tracking vehicles and pedestrians. The solution logs violations, provides a detailed dashboard, sends alerts to traffic police, and offers logs for forensic purposes.
